Current Work
Intro
 - Describe narrative / motivation
   * We were curious about the current state of technology regarding live edits to video.
   * We wanted to explore how that technology worked, what restrictions are there to real time video edits
   * We wanted to implement our own real time video editing solution, however rudimentary it may seem
   * Exploring the accessibility of real-time video editing software...?

Problem Characterization
 - Technical Description of Problem
   * Required materials include camera, desktop, and raspberry pi
   * Balancing the hardware limitations of the raspberry pi with the requirements of real-time streaming and pixel manipulation
   * Creating an intuitive and capable GUI for our application, as user input is crucial

Proposed Solution and Implementation Strategy
 - Methodology
   - History / Precedence / Planning
     * Discuss initial ideas for project
     * Discuss collaborative and iterative approach to refining idea for project
     * Discuss external influences, inspiration
     * Why did we also want to find the six most common colors in the frame?

   - Graphical User Interface
     * Why tkinter?
     * Explain the approach to the interface
     * Describe planning of layout
     * Challenges with rendering and programmatic element generation
     * Refactor due to screen requirements

   - Find Most common Colors
     * Why sklearn?
     * Discuss research of how to get the most common colors in a frame
       * M. Rake Linggar L. on the website “Towards Data Science” - https://towardsdatascience.com/finding-most-common-colors-in-python-47ea0767a06a
     * Refactor to support refresh button
     * Why was the decision made to only find the common colors in the first frame?
