Current Work
Intro
 - Describe narrative / motivation
   * We were curious about the current state of technology regarding live edits to video.
   * We wanted to explore how that technology worked, what restrictions are there to real time video edits
   * We wanted to implement our own real time video editing solution, however rudimentary it may seem
   * Exploring the accessibility of real-time video editing software...?

Problem Characterization
 - Technical Description of Problem
   * Required materials include camera, desktop, and raspberry pi
   * Balancing the hardware limitations of the raspberry pi with the requirements of real-time streaming and pixel manipulation
   * Creating an intuitive and capable GUI for our application, as user input is crucial

Proposed Solution and Implementation Strategy
 - Methodology
   - History / Precedence / Planning
     * Discuss initial ideas for project
     * Discuss collaborative and iterative approach to refining idea for project
     * Discuss external influences, inspiration

   - Graphical User Interface
     * Why tkinter?
     * Explain the approach to the interface
     * Describe planning of layout
     * Challenges with rendering and programmatic element generation
       * What prompted the need to create an entire class for UI elements?
       * Discuss initial implementation of rgb format
       * Discuss challenges faced with rgb format implementation
       * Discuss solution of bgr implementation;  Does reversing list order incur a performance penalty?
     * Discuss issues with python parameter reference scheme and challenges around deepcopying lists
     * Refactor due to screen requirements

   - Find Most common Colors
     * Why sklearn?
     * Discuss research of how to get the most common colors in a frame
       * M. Rake Linggar L. on the website “Towards Data Science” - https://towardsdatascience.com/finding-most-common-colors-in-python-47ea0767a06a
     * Refactor to support refresh button
     * Why was the decision made to only find the common colors in the first frame?

   - Getting Real Time Video
     * Why cv2?
     * Discuss challenges with frame rate
     * Discuss decision to multithread the video
     * Discuss frame queue and handling distributing the color frames throughout the program
     * Why separate RealtimeVideo from DisplayGUI?

   - Event Structure
     * Why have a class to handle user events?
     * why not use an external library for user events?
     * Why make a scheme for user events when the only one implemented is refresh?
     * Why did refresh require an event scheme?

   - Editing Colors of New Frame
     * Why a new file?
     * Discuss original implementation of color editing
     * Discuss challenges with bit masking
     * Discuss solution and adding feature of editing more than one color
     * Discuss decision to use named colors
       * Why did you use names instead of changing UI elements with hex/rgb values?
       * Was it worth it to use the excel table?
     * Discuss implementing method to find the closest color to the color the user chose

Conclusions
 - Restate goals
   * Goal: Exploring technology surrounding live video manipulation
   * Goal: Learn to work within the restrictions of the Raspberry Pi hardware
   * Goal: Determining the accessibility of real time video editing software...?

 - Reflection and Retrospective
   * Why did we also want to find the six most common colors in the frame?
